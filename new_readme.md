# Idiolect
> a native speaker's unique, idiosyncratic way of using the language

## Getting Started
Idiolect consists of YouTube playlists that are __unlisted__ and __collaborative__. *Unlisted* means the playlist is publicly accessible. *Collaborative* means any 
user can add their own videos to the playlist! Each playlist has an associated set of instructions that advises students how to participate. 

### Steps
1. Videorecord yourself in your __native__ language and add your video to the corresponding native language playlist.
2. Watch several videos from the playlist of your target language *as spoken by native speakers*. Use the comments section to ask questions!
3. Videorecord yourself in your __target__ language and add your video to the corresponding target language playlist.
4. Watch several videos from the playlist of your target language *as spoken by fellow students*. Use the comments section to critique and congratulate!
