# Background

After reading Becoming Fluent, I had an idea to build an app that would let learners mimic immersion. I surveyed all the apps in the market and only Yabla came close to accomplishing this task. This document is a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) to test if Idiolect is a compelling idea. Some core tenets of the approach:

1. Zone of Proximal Development. Material should only be moderately more difficult than the student's present level. Watching TV and movies in the target language exceeds the zone of proximal development.
2. Students should be exposed to as many native speakers as possible. Proper exposure includes visually seeing natives speaking.
3. Adult students may benefit more from fellow student-teachers rather than native teachers.

# Methodology

1. The Idiolect project will provide the guidance, i.e. programming.
2. Students will create native content, which becomes learning material for natives.
3. Students will record their own version of the content in their target language.
